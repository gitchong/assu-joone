Two-way neural net for university course: Learning automata. Net is trained with attached data set and interrogated with similar data set (with deviations). Implemented in Java with ([JOONE engine](http://www.jooneworld.com/)).
Joone is a Java framework to build and run AI applications based on neural networks.
It consists of a modular architecture based on linkable components that can be extended to build new learning algorithms and neural networks architectures. All the components have specific features, like persistence, multithreading, serialization and parameterisation.
